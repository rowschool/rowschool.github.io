        <p><strong>Instructors must be aware of their blind spots</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> regarding their performance in tasks they have been doing for a long time. Schwartz et al. mention the </span><span style=font-weight: 400;>expert blind spot</span><span style=font-weight: 400;> where professionals donâ€™t know how they do things (with conscious awareness) because their prior practice resulted in </span><span style=font-weight: 400;>chunking</span><span style=font-weight: 400;> which automated many of the subprocedures involved in the task.
