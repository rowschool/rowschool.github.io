        <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Permanent exhibits at the CM are based on the philosophy of Play with Real Stuff where students of all ages are encouraged to find their own answers through hands-on exploration in art and science. This kind of active engagement with material is likely to solidify lessons and bridge the gap between abstract instruction and real-world application.</span></p>
