        <p>Assessment can be framed using <strong>rubrics</strong> which <strong>map student performance to course goals</strong>. By mapping assessment content to the standards which these goals are (ideally) derived from students are much more likely to not only perform well in the class (pending delivery of well-designed instruction) but also <strong>meet requirements put forth by state and national standardized testing bodies</strong>.</p>
