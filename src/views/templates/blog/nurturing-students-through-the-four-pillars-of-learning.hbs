    <article class="blog-post-content">
        <p>ECS works to grow citizens along <strong>four pillars - Catalyst Character Collaboration and Commitment.</strong></p>
        <p>They work to build an equitable educational environment by accommodating for all students and tailor instruction to meet students' needs with a 10-12:1 student:teacher ratio. They focus on <strong>the Whole Child</strong>:</p>
        <p><strong>- health</strong>
            <strong>- safety</strong>
            <strong>- engagement</strong>
            <strong>- support</strong>
            <strong>- challenge</strong>
        </p>
        <p>while <strong>modeling behavior</strong> that's expected from students.</p>
        <p>The curriculum at ECS is based on an ecoliteracy program facilitating the growth of students who strive to <strong>embody the qualities indicated by the four pillars</strong>. They do this by studying places and spaces in Pittsburgh and <strong>creating meaning by connecting course content to their community</strong>. </p>
