        <p>Carver refers to the work of McAfee Leong &amp; Bodrova (2004) stating that <strong>effective assessments are sound sensitive and systematic.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sensitive assessments</strong> <strong>align the developmental characteristics of learners to their learning contexts</strong> (e.g. younger students require more careful wording and visual cues). Sensitive assessments also <strong>take into account individual differences</strong> including culture and gender effects which can enhance both the internal validity of the assessment and its generalizability.</p>
