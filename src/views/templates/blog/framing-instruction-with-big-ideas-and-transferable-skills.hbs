    <h1 class="blog-post-title">Framing Instruction with Big Ideas and Transferable Skills</h1>

    <article class="blog-post-content">
        <p><strong>Content standards</strong> exist to help teachers prioritize work bridging between deep understanding of transferable Big Ideas and assessable competence at core performance-related tasks. Directly opposed to this framework is the presentation (and often rote memorization) of discrete units of unconnected knowledge seemingly unguided by overarching goals.</p>
        <p>To design instruction which helps students learn transferable strategies via Big Ideas <strong>lessons should be framed within the context of their field creating structure and scaffolds for students to construct knowledge upon. Facilitated learning</strong> leads students to the central most important ideas within a topic building a bridge between what students already know and engaging students in a sense-making process to understand that which they do not know about how the disparate facts in a field are connected. </p>
