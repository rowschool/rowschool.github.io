        <p><strong>How can instructors bridge the gap between students' motivation and how they value the course material?</strong></p>
        <p>Students are <strong>more likely to pay attention to and retain information</strong> if it is paired with a salient exciting event. This can be neurochemical - like a cup of coffee - or shocking - like a gorilla walking through a basketball game. For in-person and e-Learning activities <strong>interactivity and variable rewards</strong> (Howard-Jones Demetriou Bogacz Yoo &amp; Leonards 2011) <strong>boost arousal motivation and memory retention</strong>.</p>
        <p>Instructors can also:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>connect the material to students' interests</li>
            <li>provide authentic real-world tasks</li>
            <li>show how the material is relevant to students' current academic lives</li>
            <li>demonstrate the relevance of higher-level skills to students' professional lives</li>
            <li>identify and reward what is valued in class and</li>
            <li>display passion and enthusiasm themselves.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How can instructors create positive expectancies as students pursue course objectives?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>provide targeted feedback</li>
            <li>articulate expectations with tools like rubrics</li>
            <li>align educational goals instruction and assessment strategies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When students feel more supported receive feedback and demonstrate their knowledge they will have a clearer view of what is expected of them and will be more motivated as a consequence of the confidence and control they have in their learning. Teachers to prepare students for success can also</p>
        <ul>
            <li>describe effective study strategies and</li>
            <li>educate students about the ways we explain success and failure.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code>
</code></pre>
        <p>Students oriented toward a <strong>growth mindset</strong> and equipped with the skills to succeed are <strong>more likely to attribute their success to an internal locus of control</strong> and remain motivated. Students will adjust their expectations - that is to succeed - if they are given choices in terms of the specific knowledge they acquire via topics for papers and questions for class discussion.</p>
        <p><strong>Giving students time to reflect</strong> - asking them what they learned from an assignment or what the most valuable part of a project was to them - helps them to articulate strategies for success moving forward as they retrospectively <strong>review how they prepared what skills they used and what they can change moving forward</strong>.</p>
