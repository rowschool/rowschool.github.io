    <article class="blog-post-content">
        Students can perform well on assessments without truly understanding the material and those who understand the material might forget facts or mix them up.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        The goal of the instructor is to ensure that students don't:</p>
        - make clever guesses</p>
        - regurgitate from memory what was learned</p>
        - put forth lots of hard work and enthusiasm</p>
        - produce products and performances or&nbsp;</p>
        - apply their natural competences well</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        while having little to no understanding about the content. In this context understanding is qualified by <strong>students building mental models around a courseâ€™s Big Ideas while meeting course performance goals and achieving high scores/grades</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> while doing so.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        This requires that task/goal alignment and assessment/goal alignment in addition to understanding what learners have understood in the course itself.</p>
