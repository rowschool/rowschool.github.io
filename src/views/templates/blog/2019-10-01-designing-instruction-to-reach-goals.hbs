        <p><strong>Content standards</strong> exist to help teachers prioritize work bridging between deep understanding of transferable Big Ideas and assessable competence at core performance-related tasks.

Facilitated learning</strong> leads students to the central most important ideas within a topic building a bridge between what students already know and engaging students in a sense-making process to understand that which they do not know about how the disparate facts in a field are connected. </p>
