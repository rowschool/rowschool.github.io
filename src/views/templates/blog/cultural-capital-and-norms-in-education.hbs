    <h1 class="blog-post-title">Cultural Capital and Norms in Education</h1>

    <article class="blog-post-content">
        <p>"Cultural capital" refers to Pierre Bourdieuâ€™s concept that <em>certain forms of cultural knowledge are the equivalent of symbolic wealth</em>. These cultural (and linguistic) knowledge bases and skills <strong>are socially inherited</strong> and <strong>are believed to facilitate academic achievement</strong>. (Bartolome 1994)</p>
        <p>Norms are rules of social interaction. Norms are prescriptions of conduct and are a subset of values. Values are beliefs about what is important.</p>
        <p><em>Socially constructed rules</em> unlike physical laws <em>can be broken</em>. To enforce dependable social interactions <em>social rules come with incentives for compliance and sanctions for noncompliance</em>.</p>
        <p>First <strong>norms can become values</strong>. For example <strong>a norm</strong> of giving up a bus seat for the elderly <strong>can become a belief</strong> about how the elderly should be treated. For disciplinary norms <em>checking scientific claims against evidence can eventually become a belief that ideas should be checked against evidence</em>.</p>
        <p>Second <strong>norms can produce a sense of belonging</strong>. One example is how colleagues shake hands when they greet each other.</p>
        <p>Belonging is the perception of <em>being accepted valued and included</em>. Belonging can help learning by <strong>increasing effort and decreasing negative distracting thoughts</strong>.</p>
        <p>Third <em>norms contribute to identity development</em>. Different cultures have different norms so <strong>partaking in a set of norms increases identification with the given culture</strong>. Inversely <em>if one wants to maintain an exclusive identity</em> with one cultural group <em>they take an oppositional stance</em> to other norms (Schwartz et al. 2016).</p>
