        <p><strong>At the start of a semester</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> insert classroom activities and extracurriculars into a calendar. Review the upcoming month once per week alerting yourself if several assignments are due at the same time and you need to start studying early. </span><strong>Setting calendar reminders</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> for the week before an exam project or recurring events like quizzes can prevent things from slipping through the cracks. Time management is crucial - in addition to attending class it helps learners to review one day’s work in the evening and also prepare for the following day’s assignments.</span></p>

        <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>This is an example of </span><strong>The Spacing Effect</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> - learning and internalizing information over time gradually. Another example is reading about a concept before class and then hearing it in lecture after a delay making it more likely you’ll remember the concept in the future. This is an advantage of the “reviewing and preparing” model mentioned above.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>A caveat of this approach is that learners much make sure they </span><strong>get enough sleep</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> and don’t stay up late to study.</span></p>
