        <p>Teachers can teach students how to self-assess their learning by teaching them how to plan the right approaches in applying their skills to various tasks. As students develop better cognitive maps and better understand how various concepts in a course are connected they can improve their abilities not only in formative and summative assessments but also in the process of <strong>self-assessment (addressing one's own strengths/weaknesses reviewing prior grades and assignment feedback)</strong> which furthers learning.</p>
