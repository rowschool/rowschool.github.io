        <p>To help students better organize their knowledge schemas teachers can reflect on organizing principles for the knowledge they work with students to construct. This <strong>requires some metacognition on the part of teachers</strong> reflecting on how they themselves organize the course in their own minds. Therefore in order to understand <strong>how learners organize knowledge teachers must reflect</strong> on their own ideas and connected concepts.</p>
        <p>To target students who have robust foundations ready to build subsequent learning upon teachers should ensure students have <strong>a strongly connected knowledge network which maximizes the likelihood of the quick prior knowledge retrieval</strong> (Bradshaw &amp; Anderson 1982; Reder &amp; Anderson 1980; Smith Adams &amp; Schorr 1978). Robust knowledge networks are constructed via meaning and internal conceptualizations of the tasks skills or effort courses require. Students who develop metacognitive skills - to reflect upon and refine what they know - are more likely to plan and implement effortful strategies to further their own learning and development.</p>
        <p>Furthermore studies by Schommer (1994) and Henderson &amp; Dweck (1990) found that a positive relationship between studentsâ€™ beliefs that intelligence is incremental and their perceived self-efficacy and motivation. Students with a <strong>growth mindset</strong> - who believe that through practice iteration and reflection they can achieve more in a course - are more likely to have the <strong>intrinsic motivation to develop metacognitive skills</strong>.</p>
