        "<span style=font-weight: 400;>Cultural capital</span><span style=font-weight: 400;>” refers to Pierre Bourdieu’s concept that </span><i><span style=font-weight: 400;>certain forms of cultural knowledge are the equivalent of symbolic wealth</span></i><span style=font-weight: 400;>. These cultural (and linguistic) knowledge bases and skills </span><strong>are socially inherited</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> and </span><strong>are believed to facilitate academic achievement</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;>. (Bartolome 1994)</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Norms<span style=font-weight: 400;> are rules of social interaction. Norms are prescriptions of conduct and are a subset of values. </span><span style=font-weight: 400;>Values</span><span style=font-weight: 400;> are beliefs about what is important.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><i><span style=font-weight: 400;>Socially constructed rules</span></i><span style=font-weight: 400;> unlike physical laws </span><i><span style=font-weight: 400;>can be broken</span></i><span style=font-weight: 400;>. To enforce dependable social interactions </span><i><span style=font-weight: 400;>social rules come with incentives for compliance and sanctions for noncompliance</span></i><span style=font-weight: 400;>.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        First <strong>norms can become values</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;>. For example </span><strong>a norm</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> of giving up a bus seat for the elderly </span><strong>can become a belief</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> about how the elderly should be treated. For disciplinary norms </span><i><span style=font-weight: 400;>checking scientific claims against evidence can eventually become a belief that ideas should be checked against evidence</span></i><span style=font-weight: 400;>.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Second <strong>norms can produce a sense of belonging</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;>. One example is how colleagues shake hands when they greet each other.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        Belonging<span style=font-weight: 400;> is the perception of </span><i><span style=font-weight: 400;>being accepted valued and included</span></i><span style=font-weight: 400;>. Belonging can help learning by </span><strong>increasing effort and decreasing negative distracting thoughts</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;>.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><br><span style=font-weight: 400;>Third </span><i><span style=font-weight: 400;>norms contribute to identity development</span></i><span style=font-weight: 400;>. Different cultures have different norms so </span><strong>partaking in a set of norms increases identification with the given culture</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;>. Inversely </span><i><span style=font-weight: 400;>if one wants to maintain an exclusive identity</span></i><span style=font-weight: 400;> with one cultural group </span><i><span style=font-weight: 400;>they take an oppositional stance</span></i><span style=font-weight: 400;> to other norms (Schwartz et al. 2016).</span></p>
