        <p>Students learn more when they are actively engaged than in a passive learning environment. <strong>Active teaching strategies increase students' attendance engagement and acquisition of expert attitudes</strong> toward college-level science courses. However there is a <strong>sharp contrast between how students feel about their learning and how much they actually learn</strong>. The literature supports two explanations:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                **lecture-based teaching** engages students cognitively to the point that **they think they are learning more than they actually are**
            </li>
            <li>
                **novices** in a subject are ill-equipped to gauge how much they are learning because of their **poor metacognitive skills**
            </li>
            <li>
                students who are unfamiliar with active learning may not appreciate that the **cognitive struggle involved is actually a sign that learning is effective**.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>and suggested by Deslauriers et al. (2018)</p>
        <p>Students in the study experienced confusion and more cognitive effort during the small-group activities interspersed throughout lectures and interpreted this as a sign of poor learning. Students in an active learning environment also cited <strong>transitions from group activities to instructor feedback concerns that errors made during class would not be corrected and a general feeling of frustration and confusion</strong> when discussing concerns about actively taught classes.</p>
        <p>The success of active learning depends on students' <strong>motivation and engagement</strong> and <strong>students must be taught to self-regulate</strong> negative emotions as they struggle with new material or participate in group work with others. </p>
