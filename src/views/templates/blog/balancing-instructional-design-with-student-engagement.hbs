    <h1 class="blog-post-title">Balancing Instructional Design with Student Engagement</h1>

    <article class="blog-post-content">
        <p>Instruction much like real world tasks is to be approached and built after a series of compromises which determine the right balance of elements in the instructional design. After an initial version instructors can see how their design works <strong>iterate and get feedback</strong> against desired results and content/design standards.</p>
        <p>Good instruction consists of activities exercises and presentations aligned with overarching important questions. Those questions which capture student interest are most likely to be Big Ideas - the sometimes paradoxical and often counterintuitive <strong>Truths of the discipline</strong>. Capturing student interest can lead to meaning- and sense-making as students themselves iterate on their own knowledge throughout the course via depth and breadth by uncovering and constructing it themselves.</p>
