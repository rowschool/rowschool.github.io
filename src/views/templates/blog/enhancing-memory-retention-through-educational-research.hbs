    <h1 class="blog-post-title">Enhancing Memory Retention Through Educational Research</h1>

    <article class="blog-post-content">

Can students be primed to study topics subjects or facts at specific intervals to retain knowledge and can commercial applications like the app <strong>SuperMemo</strong> be brought into the educational technology space to <strong>bolster students' memories</strong> successfully? <strong>Evidence shows (Shulman 1999) that courses can be changed to do so.</strong></p>
