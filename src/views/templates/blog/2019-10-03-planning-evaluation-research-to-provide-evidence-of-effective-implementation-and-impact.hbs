        <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Researchers can begin by </span><strong>conducting longitudinal research on the effects of students employing metacognitive strategies such as reflection and revising of knowledge structures</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> and </span><strong>how students evaluate the perceived cost of switching knowledge acquisition strategies for gains in performance</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;>.</span></p>

        <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Ericsson Chase and Faloon (1980) and Ericsson &amp; Staszewski (1989) illustrated how college students can develop highly connected knowledge organizations in terms of multilevel hierarchical structures of digits. These </span><strong>chunks</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> of knowledge can be elaborated by researchers in various fields across multitudes of domains. Bower et al. (1969) has demonstrated this with minerals and Ausubel (1960 1978) demonstrated how students showed similar learning gains when given a set of principles or propositions that provide a cognitive structure to guide the incorporation of new information (an advance organizer).</span></p>

This research could have implications for course design and knowledge scaffolding in courses where demand for personalized learning is only increasing.</span></p>
