After signing a blanket permission form for the child to participate in any research projects conducted at the school parents are kept in the loop with abstracts of studies being conducted and updates about completed studies in the school's monthly newsletter. </span><strong>This likely requires a more thoroughly developed understanding of learners’ contexts in the home.</strong></p>
