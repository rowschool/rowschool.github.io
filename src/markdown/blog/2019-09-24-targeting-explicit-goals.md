<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>The goal of the laboratory school is to establish a beneficial synergy between educational theory research and practice while facilitating growth for the Whole Child sharing teaching strategies and providing professional development for pre-service teachers while creating a curriculum rooted in psychological theory. The </span><strong>basic learning goals of the Children's School</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> are:</span></p>

<ol>  <li> <span style=font-weight: 400;> encouraging each child's </span><strong>Self-Esteem &amp; Independence</strong> </li>  <li> <span style=font-weight: 400;> promoting children's social </span><strong>Interaction &amp; Cooperation</strong> </li>  <li> <span style=font-weight: 400;> facilitating comprehension and </span><strong>Communication</strong> </li>  <li> <span style=font-weight: 400;> </span><strong>Discovery &amp; Exploration</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;>—fostering a positive attitude</span> </li>  <li> <span style=font-weight: 400;> giving children opportunities to use their </span><strong>Physical Capabilities</strong> </li>  <li> <span style=font-weight: 400;> </span><strong>Creativity</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;>—cultivating each child's ability to express ideas</span> </li>  </ol>

<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Carver and colleagues developed these goal statements by </span><strong>interviewing preschoolers from around the country</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> </span><strong>integrating teachers' experiences</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> and applying knowledge of </span><strong>developmental research</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> to add depth and breadth in cognitive areas while ensuring they were following natural developmental sequences. Other schools would be served well by doing the same.</span></p>
