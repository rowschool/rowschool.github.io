The goal of the laboratory school is to establish a beneficial synergy between educational theory research and practice while facilitating growth for the Whole Child sharing teaching strategies and providing professional development for pre-service teachers while creating a curriculum rooted in psychological theory. The **basic learning goals of the Children's School** are:

<ol>  <li>  encouraging each child's **Self-Esteem &amp; Independence** </li>  <li>  promoting children's social **Interaction &amp; Cooperation** </li>  <li>  facilitating comprehension and **Communication** </li>  <li>  **Discovery &amp; Exploration**—fostering a positive attitude </li>  <li>  giving children opportunities to use their **Physical Capabilities** </li>  <li>  **Creativity**—cultivating each child's ability to express ideas </li>  </ol>

Carver and colleagues developed these goal statements by **interviewing preschoolers from around the country** **integrating teachers' experiences** and applying knowledge of **developmental research** to add depth and breadth in cognitive areas while ensuring they were following natural developmental sequences. Other schools would be served well by doing the same.
