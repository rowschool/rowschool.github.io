<span style=font-weight: 400;>The goal of the laboratory school is to establish a beneficial synergy between educational theory research and practice while facilitating growth for the Whole Child sharing teaching strategies and providing professional development for pre-service teachers while creating a curriculum rooted in psychological theory. The </span>**basic learning goals of the Children's School**<span style=font-weight: 400;> are:</span>

<ol>  <li> <span style=font-weight: 400;> encouraging each child's </span>**Self-Esteem &amp; Independence** </li>  <li> <span style=font-weight: 400;> promoting children's social </span>**Interaction &amp; Cooperation** </li>  <li> <span style=font-weight: 400;> facilitating comprehension and </span>**Communication** </li>  <li> <span style=font-weight: 400;> </span>**Discovery &amp; Exploration**<span style=font-weight: 400;>—fostering a positive attitude</span> </li>  <li> <span style=font-weight: 400;> giving children opportunities to use their </span>**Physical Capabilities** </li>  <li> <span style=font-weight: 400;> </span>**Creativity**<span style=font-weight: 400;>—cultivating each child's ability to express ideas</span> </li>  </ol>

<span style=font-weight: 400;>Carver and colleagues developed these goal statements by </span>**interviewing preschoolers from around the country**<span style=font-weight: 400;> </span>**integrating teachers' experiences**<span style=font-weight: 400;> and applying knowledge of </span>**developmental research**<span style=font-weight: 400;> to add depth and breadth in cognitive areas while ensuring they were following natural developmental sequences. Other schools would be served well by doing the same.</span>
