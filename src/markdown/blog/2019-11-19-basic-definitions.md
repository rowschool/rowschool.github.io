Traditionally experimentalists strive for **internal validity** which enables clear causal conclusions discrimination of constructs and predictions regarding future performance.

Learning sciences researchers instead often emphasize an aspect of **external validity**: ecological validity (i.e. the assessmentâ€™s alignment with realistic contexts of learning).

Recently developmental scientists Hirsh-Pasek Kochanoff Newcombe and deVilliers (2005) introduced the concept of **empirical validity** to stress that assessments should be based on solid research foundations.
