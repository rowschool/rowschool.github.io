<p>**Frames**</p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>frames</span><span style=font-weight: 400;> - principles of organization which govern events – at least social ones – and our subjective involvement in them which people share (Goffman 1986:10-11)</span></p>

<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>The term </span><span style=font-weight: 400;>frame</span><span style=font-weight: 400;> is used to refer to messages defining intentions of communication in the sense that a picture frame delimits the picture within it and distinguishes the picture from the surrounding wall. Accordingly Tannen (1984:23) defines "frame" as "a superordinate message about how the com- munication is intended."</span></p>

<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>The notion of frames goes back to Bateson (1972) who identified three different levels of communication:</span></p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>(1) the denotative level (i.e. referential level)</span></p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>(2) the metalinguistic level (i.e. the purpose of communication is to talk about language) and </span></p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>(3) the meta-communicative level (i.e. communication concerning the relationship between the speakers).</span></p>

<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>On the meta-communicative level people send intentionally or unintentionally a message that tells the intention of the communication. For example when one says "I hate you" on the denotative level s/he may send signals telling that the communication is intended to be "joking." </span></p>

<p>**Observational Learning**</p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>"Learning by watching is called observational learning."</span></p>

<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>"Theory of mind enables people to infer the goals of another person. This is important for observational learning. It helps the observer figure out which parts of a behavior to imitate and how to make useful variations. "</span></p>

<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>"Observing other people receive positive reinforcement for a behavior is called vicarious reward because people vicariously project into the positive reinforcement."</span></p>
