Assessments in diverse classrooms may take on <i>the ethos of an inclusive classroom</i>; that is practices like oral exams or formative assessments in the form of "think-alouds" to understand how students think about the task at hand. Enabling students to articulate through their own thought processes implicitly places the student in a position of competence.

In addition students who encounter stereotype threat regarding their gender race or socioeconomic circumstances may experience higher negative emotions and decrease learning and test performance. **A formative assessment where teachers place trust in students to exercise knowledge competently may reduce those negative emotions.**
