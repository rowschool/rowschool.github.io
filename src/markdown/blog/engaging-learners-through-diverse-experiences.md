Students don't grasp the Big Ideas of a course when its content like a textbook is arranged logically. To be true to how people actually learn students must be presented with chances to use the content presented in a **disciplined** way with **a variety of learning experiences to engage various learning styles**. This sparks the pursuit of performance mastery and relegates the role of textbooks to a point of reference as students iteratively go through course Big Ideas in the pursuit of understanding.
