"Cultural capital" refers to Pierre Bourdieu’s concept that <i>certain forms of cultural knowledge are the equivalent of symbolic wealth</i>. These cultural (and linguistic) knowledge bases and skills **are socially inherited** and **are believed to facilitate academic achievement**. (Bartolome 1994)

Norms are rules of social interaction. Norms are prescriptions of conduct and are a subset of values. Values are beliefs about what is important. 

<i>Socially constructed rules</i> unlike physical laws <i>can be broken</i>. To enforce dependable social interactions <i>social rules come with incentives for compliance and sanctions for noncompliance</i>. 

First **norms can become values**. For example **a norm** of giving up a bus seat for the elderly **can become a belief** about how the elderly should be treated. For disciplinary norms <i>checking scientific claims against evidence can eventually become a belief that ideas should be checked against evidence</i>. 

Second **norms can produce a sense of belonging**. One example is how colleagues shake hands when they greet each other.

Belonging is the perception of <i>being accepted valued and included</i>. Belonging can help learning by **increasing effort and decreasing negative distracting thoughts**. </p>  <p><br>Third <i>norms contribute to identity development</i>. Different cultures have different norms so **partaking in a set of norms increases identification with the given culture**. Inversely <i>if one wants to maintain an exclusive identity</i> with one cultural group <i>they take an oppositional stance</i> to other norms (Schwartz et al. 2016).
