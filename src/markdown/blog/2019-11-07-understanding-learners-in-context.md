Students learn more when they are actively engaged than in a passive learning environment. **Active teaching strategies increase students' attendance engagement and acquisition of expert attitudes** toward college-level science courses. However there is a **sharp contrast between how students feel about their learning and how much they actually learn**. The literature supports two explanations:

<ol>  <li> **lecture-based teaching** engages students cognitively to the point that **they think they are learning more than they actually are** </li>  <li> **novices** in a subject are ill-equipped to gauge how much they are learning because of their **poor metacognitive skills** </li>  </ol>

and suggested by Deslauriers et al. (2018) 

<ol start=3>  <li>  students who are unfamiliar with active learning may not appreciate that the **cognitive struggle involved is actually a sign that learning is effective**. </li>  </ol>

Students in the study experienced confusion and more cognitive effort during the small-group activities interspersed throughout lectures and interpreted this as a sign of poor learning. Students in an active learning environment also cited **transitions from group activities to instructor feedback concerns that errors made during class would not be corrected and a general feeling of frustration and confusion** when discussing concerns about actively taught classes. 

The success of active learning depends on students' **motivation and engagement** and **students must be taught to self-regulate** negative emotions as they struggle with new material or participate in group work with others.
