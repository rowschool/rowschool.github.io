<span style=font-weight: 400;>Students learn more when they are actively engaged than in a passive learning environment. </span>**Active teaching strategies increase students' attendance engagement and acquisition of expert attitudes**<span style=font-weight: 400;> toward college-level science courses. However there is a </span>**sharp contrast between how students feel about their learning and how much they actually learn**<span style=font-weight: 400;>. The literature supports two explanations:</span>

<ol>  <li> **lecture-based teaching**<span style=font-weight: 400;> engages students cognitively to the point that </span>**they think they are learning more than they actually are**<span style=font-weight: 400;></span> </li>  <li> **novices**<span style=font-weight: 400;> in a subject are ill-equipped to gauge how much they are learning because of their </span>**poor metacognitive skills**<span style=font-weight: 400;></span> </li>  </ol>

<span style=font-weight: 400;>and suggested by Deslauriers et al. (2018) </span>

<ol start=3>  <li> <span style=font-weight: 400;> students who are unfamiliar with active learning may not appreciate that the </span>**cognitive struggle involved is actually a sign that learning is effective**<span style=font-weight: 400;>.</span> </li>  </ol>

<span style=font-weight: 400;>Students in the study experienced confusion and more cognitive effort during the small-group activities interspersed throughout lectures and interpreted this as a sign of poor learning. Students in an active learning environment also cited </span>**transitions from group activities to instructor feedback concerns that errors made during class would not be corrected and a general feeling of frustration and confusion**<span style=font-weight: 400;> when discussing concerns about actively taught classes. </span>

<span style=font-weight: 400;>The success of active learning depends on students' </span>**motivation and engagement**<span style=font-weight: 400;> and </span>**students must be taught to self-regulate**<span style=font-weight: 400;> negative emotions as they struggle with new material or participate in group work with others. </span>
