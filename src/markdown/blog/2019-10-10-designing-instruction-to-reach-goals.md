<p>**Instructors must be aware of their blind spots**<span style=font-weight: 400;> regarding their performance in tasks they have been doing for a long time. Schwartz et al. mention the </span><span style=font-weight: 400;>expert blind spot</span><span style=font-weight: 400;> where professionals donâ€™t know how they do things (with conscious awareness) because their prior practice resulted in </span><span style=font-weight: 400;>chunking</span><span style=font-weight: 400;> which automated many of the subprocedures involved in the task. This frees up working memory and enables the expert to further enhance their abilities.</span></p>  <p><br><span style=font-weight: 400;>Teachers can also encourage students to </span>**metacognitively review their own work**<span style=font-weight: 400;> considering baselines of performance comparing them to their own and deliberately correcting work to improve and further the pursuit of task mastery.</span></p>
