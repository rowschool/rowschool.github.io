<ol>  <li><span style=font-weight: 400;> attempts to bridge the divide between research and practice.</span></li>  </ol>

<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Some LS researchers have explored alternative methods for analyzing and assessing the impact of interventions. One approach is to adopt a design-oriented philosophy more commonly associated with engineering fields than with social science. The design-based influences can be traced back in part to the Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Artificial Intelligence and Education (AI &amp; Ed) communities whose work inspired early LS research on learning environment development that later spawned research in educational technology and human behavior more broadly.</span></p>

<ol start=2>  <li><span style=font-weight: 400;> is motivated by limitations of theories of learning and cognition for specifying instruction.</span></li>  </ol>

<ol start=3>  <li><span style=font-weight: 400;> embraces the importance of analyzing and assessing complex interventions through both experimental and design-based research.</span></li>  </ol>

<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Design experiments allow for a vastly expanded tool kit of data collection and analysis methods that have been developed to address questions about settings people and phenomena that do not lend themselves easily to classic experimental methods.</span></p>

<ol start=4>  <li><span style=font-weight: 400;> emphasizes the learning and behavior of the individual in interaction with the physical social and cultural world as well as with semiotic and technical resources.</span></li>  </ol>

<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>These four themes unified under a time scale framework can function together along with their disparate research traditions and methods to capture how learning and complex behavior arises. Aggregated or higher time scale research on cognitive tutors constrains research at lower levels providing it a target phenomenon that needs further explication (109) such as the work on classroom interactions among peers and the teacher (133) on visual processes used in attending to hints from the tutor (117 118) and on neural processes involved in encoding information (119). This integrated research then informs theories of learning that constrain the design of future learning environments leading to a virtuous cycle of scaling up and down to further the science of learning.</span></p>
