**How can instructors bridge the gap between students' motivation and how they value the course material?**

Students are **more likely to pay attention to and retain information** if it is paired with a salient exciting event. This can be neurochemical - like a cup of coffee - or shocking - like a gorilla walking through a basketball game. For in-person and e-Learning activities **interactivity and variable rewards** (Howard-Jones Demetriou Bogacz Yoo &amp; Leonards 2011) **boost arousal motivation and memory retention**.

Instructors can also:

<ul>  
	<li>connect the material to students' interests</li>  
	<li>provide authentic real-world tasks</li>  
	<li>show how the material is relevant to students' current academic lives</li>  
	<li>demonstrate the relevance of higher-level skills to students' professional lives</li>  
	<li>identify and reward what is valued in class and</li>  
	<li>display passion and enthusiasm themselves.</li>
</ul>

**How can instructors create positive expectancies as students pursue course objectives?**

<ul>  
	<li>provide targeted feedback</li>  
	<li>articulate expectations with tools like rubrics</li>  
	<li>align educational goals instruction and assessment strategies</li>  
</ul>

When students feel more supported receive feedback and demonstrate their knowledge they will have a clearer view of what is expected of them and will be more motivated as a consequence of the confidence and control they have in their learning. Teachers to prepare students for success can also

<ul>  
	<li>describe effective study strategies and</li>  
	<li>educate students about the ways we explain success and failure.</li>  
</ul>	

Students oriented toward a **growth mindset** and equipped with the skills to succeed are **more likely to attribute their success to an internal locus of control** and remain motivated. Students will adjust their expectations - that is to succeed - if they are given choices in terms of the specific knowledge they acquire via topics for papers and questions for class discussion.

**Giving students time to reflect** - asking them what they learned from an assignment or what the most valuable part of a project was to them - helps them to articulate strategies for success moving forward as they retrospectively **review how they prepared what skills they used and what they can change moving forward**.
