(2016)</a> cite five books at the end of the paper which provide a "wealth of information … about specific study strategies and the research behind them." He also states (or rather admits) that some of the suggestions presented in this paper are based on a sample size of one so it may be helpful to expand upon these statements although statements such as "Go to class" seem self-evident in supporting academic performance.</span>

<span style=font-weight: 400;>Findings and suggestions that could be investigated include verifying or repeating studies applying </span>**the use of active study techniques**<span style=font-weight: 400;> like self-quizzing the Spacing Effect (studying each subject a little bit each day) and the effectiveness of flashcards as a retrieval practice within different educational contexts and applications.</span>

<span style=font-weight: 400;>In addition Putnam et al. posit that </span>**students should try to limit rereading to when they are confused about a particular topic**<span style=font-weight: 400;> even after self-quizzing. This claim and </span>**study groups that quiz and teach each other**<span style=font-weight: 400;> are fertile ground for learning science investigation.</span>
