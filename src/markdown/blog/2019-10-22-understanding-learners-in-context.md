ECS works to grow citizens along **four pillars - Catalyst Character Collaboration and Commitment.**

They work to build an equitable educational environment by accommodating for all students and tailor instruction to meet students' needs with a 10-12:1 student:teacher ratio. They focus on **the Whole Child**:</p>  <p>**- health**</p>  <p>**- safety**</p>  <p>**- engagement**</p>  <p>**- support**</p>  <p>**- challenge**

while **modeling behavior** that's expected from students.Â 

The curriculum at ECS is based on an ecoliteracy program facilitating the growth of students who strive to **embody the qualities indicated by the four pillars**. They do this by studying places and spaces in Pittsburgh and **creating meaning by connecting course content to their community**.
