<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>To help students better organize their knowledge schemas teachers can reflect on organizing principles for the knowledge they work with students to construct. This </span>**requires some metacognition on the part of teachers**<span style=font-weight: 400;> reflecting on how they themselves organize the course in their own minds. Therefore in order to understand </span>**how learners organize knowledge teachers must reflect**<span style=font-weight: 400;> on their own ideas and connected concepts.</span></p>

<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>To target students who have robust foundations ready to build subsequent learning upon teachers should ensure students have </span>**a strongly connected knowledge network which maximizes the likelihood of the quick prior knowledge retrieval**<span style=font-weight: 400;> (Bradshaw &amp; Anderson 1982; Reder &amp; Anderson 1980; Smith Adams &amp; Schorr 1978). Robust knowledge networks are constructed via meaning and internal conceptualizations of the tasks skills or effort courses require. Students who develop metacognitive skills - to reflect upon and refine what they know - are more likely to plan and implement effortful strategies to further their own learning and development.</span></p>

<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Furthermore studies by Schommer (1994) and Henderson &amp; Dweck (1990) found that a positive relationship between studentsâ€™ beliefs that intelligence is incremental and their perceived self-efficacy and motivation. Students with a </span>**growth mindset**<span style=font-weight: 400;> - who believe that through practice iteration and reflection they can achieve more in a course - are more likely to have the </span>**intrinsic motivation to develop metacognitive skills**<span style=font-weight: 400;>.</span></p>
