The Children's Museum (CM) of Pittsburgh is open every day from 10am to 5pm. Admission to the museum includes admission to MuseumLab, its new museum with exhibits and activities for kids ages 10 and older. Museum curators likely saw the value of playful educational activities for students venturing into middle school and beyond.

The CM has admission discounts for AAA members, Big Brothers & Big Sisters, food stamp recipients, UPMC, WDUQ, and WQED members. It aims to provide fun, dynamic experiences that inspire joy, creativity, and curiosity for young learners and those that provide them with meaningful interactions.
