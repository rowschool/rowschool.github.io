<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Studies can be undertaken to </span><strong>investigate the benefits of in-person lectures compared to reading a textbook</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;>. Does communicating with others or asking questions in class support </span><strong>research on active learning</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;>?</span></p>
