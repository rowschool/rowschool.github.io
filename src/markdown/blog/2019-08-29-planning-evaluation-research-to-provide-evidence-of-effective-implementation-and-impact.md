<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Putnam et al. cite five books at the end of the paper which provide a “wealth of information … about specific study strategies and the research behind them.” He also states (or rather admits) that some of the suggestions presented in this paper are based on a sample size of one so it may be helpful to expand upon these statements although statements such as “Go to class” seem self-evident in supporting academic performance.</span></p>  <p> </p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Findings and suggestions that could be investigated include verifying or repeating studies applying </span><strong>the use of active study techniques</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> like self-quizzing the Spacing Effect (studying each subject a little bit each day) and the effectiveness of flashcards as a retrieval practice within different educational contexts and applications.</span></p>  <p> </p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>In addition Putnam et al. posit that </span><strong>students should try to limit rereading to when they are confused about a particular topic</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> even after self-quizzing.
