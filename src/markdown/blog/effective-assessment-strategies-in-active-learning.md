Students participating in active learning are served well by classroom response systems (also known as clickers) which help novice students discover their own misconceptions and construct correct explanations based on the feedback clicker responses provide.

Students are also well-served by pre-course assessments which can help students gauge their own learning. Students can submit one-minute papers to the instructor during a course voicing concerns and requesting clarifying feedback.
