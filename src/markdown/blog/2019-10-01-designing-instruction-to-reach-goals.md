**Content standards** exist to help teachers prioritize work bridging between deep understanding of transferable Big Ideas and assessable competence at core performance-related tasks. Directly opposed to this framework is the presentation (and often rote memorization) of discrete units of unconnected knowledge seemingly unguided by overarching goals.

Facilitated learning** leads students to the central most important ideas within a topic building a bridge between what students already know and engaging students in a sense-making process to understand that which they do not know about how the disparate facts in a field are connected.
