Instruction much like real world tasks is to be approached and built after a series of compromises which determine the right balance of elements in the instructional design. After an initial version instructors can see how their design works **iterate and get feedback** against desired results and content/design standards.

Good instruction consists of activities exercises and presentations aligned with overarching important questions. Those questions which capture student interest are most likely to be Big Ideas - the sometimes paradoxical and often counterintuitive **Truths of the discipline**. Capturing student interest can lead to meaning- and sense-making as students themselves iterate on their own knowledge throughout the course via depth and breadth by uncovering and constructing it themselves.
