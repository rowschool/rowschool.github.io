"Cultural capital" refers to Pierre Bourdieuâ€™s concept that *certain forms of cultural knowledge are the equivalent of symbolic wealth*. These cultural (and linguistic) knowledge bases and skills **are socially inherited** and **are believed to facilitate academic achievement**. (Bartolome 1994)

Norms are rules of social interaction. Norms are prescriptions of conduct and are a subset of values. Values are beliefs about what is important.

*Socially constructed rules* unlike physical laws *can be broken*. To enforce dependable social interactions *social rules come with incentives for compliance and sanctions for noncompliance*.

First **norms can become values**. For example **a norm** of giving up a bus seat for the elderly **can become a belief** about how the elderly should be treated. For disciplinary norms *checking scientific claims against evidence can eventually become a belief that ideas should be checked against evidence*.

Second **norms can produce a sense of belonging**. One example is how colleagues shake hands when they greet each other.

Belonging is the perception of *being accepted valued and included*. Belonging can help learning by **increasing effort and decreasing negative distracting thoughts**.

Third *norms contribute to identity development*. Different cultures have different norms so **partaking in a set of norms increases identification with the given culture**. Inversely *if one wants to maintain an exclusive identity* with one cultural group *they take an oppositional stance* to other norms (Schwartz et al. 2016).
