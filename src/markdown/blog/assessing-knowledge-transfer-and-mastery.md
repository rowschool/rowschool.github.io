Students ought to be able to use their knowledge and apply it in diverse settings. This means that transfer is the outcome of successful understanding. **Can students apply what they have learned to novel situations effectively? Are their ideas flexible enough to cut through perceived misunderstandings?** This is the core of the intention of assessment.

Following administration of assessment teachers can evaluate students' misunderstandings and thereby understand their knowledge and abilities. **Misunderstandings are a consequence of unsuccessful knowledge transfer and mistakes are a chance to evaluate refine and reapply knowledge in future assessments.**

However when students transfer what knowledge they have **teachers must be wary of confirmation bias**. In the 17th century Francis Bacon noted: people project categories assumptions rules priorities attitudes and matters of style onto their realities and develop countless ways of 'proving' these instinctive ideas to be true. By **pushing students toward the habits of self-assessment and self-discipline** teachers can **inch students closer toward mastery and achieving true understanding** for real-world knowledge use and application.
