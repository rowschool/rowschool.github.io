Administering in-class formative assessments means that teachers can slow down or backtrack when there are too many wrong answers. **Types of formative assessments include**:

<ol>  <li> index card summaries and explanations of course big ideas</li>  <li> index cards with questions posed at the teacher regarding misconceptions or things students don't understand yet</li>  <li> hand signals indicating understanding or lack thereof</li>  <li> one-minute essays gauging comprehension</li>  <li> question boxes bulletin boards or an email address where students can ask about misconceptions or lack of understanding privately</li>  <li> concept maps</li>  <li> oral questioning</li>  </ol>

These checks for understanding over time **teach students to gauge their own understanding and improve metacognitive skills**.
