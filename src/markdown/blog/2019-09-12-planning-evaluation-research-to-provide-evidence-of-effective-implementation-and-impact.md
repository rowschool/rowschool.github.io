<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>How can we measure the </span>**effectiveness of sociocultural interventions**<span style=font-weight: 400;> in the classroom and the impact of teachers </span>**influencing students to change their beliefs around normative behavior**<span style=font-weight: 400;> in the classroom?</span></p>

<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Bartolome (1994) states that recent research studies have identified educational programs [that were] found to be successful in working with culturally and linguistically subordinated minority student populations (Carter &amp; Chatfield 1986; Lucas Henze &amp; Donato 1990; Tikunoff 1985; Webb 1987) and that </span>**there has been specific interest in identifying teaching strategies that more effectively teach culturally and linguistically 'different' students and other 'disadvantaged' and 'at-risk' students**<span style=font-weight: 400;> (Knapp &amp; Shields 1990; McLeod in press; Means &amp; Knapp 1991; Tinajero &amp; Ada 1993).</span></p>

<p>**Studies have found educators who can successfully employ studentsâ€™ culturally valued language practices while introducing them to more conventional and academically acceptable ways of using language.**<span style=font-weight: 400;> This phenomenon is colloquially called </span><span style=font-weight: 400;>code-switching</span><span style=font-weight: 400;>. However there must be a way as Au and Mason (1983) state to achieve cultural congruence in lessons to </span>**seek a balance between the interactional rights of teachers and students so that the children can participate in ways comfortable to them**<span style=font-weight: 400;> while remaining conflict-free. Macedo (1993) in his call for an anti-methods pedagogy calls for a rejection of the mechanization of intellectualism [and a] challenge [to] teachers to work toward </span>**reappropriation of endangered dignity and toward reclaiming our humanity**<span style=font-weight: 400;>. Congruently Rydell McConnell &amp; Beilock (2009) have found that helping people to think about themselves as </span>**having multiple identities**<span style=font-weight: 400;> in particular focusing on those facets of their identity that are in-group (e.g. college student) rather than out-group (e.g. female) improves performance for those at risk of stereotype threat.</span></p>

<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Future studies can focus on the implications of stereotype threat in the context of classrooms that employ these teaching strategies with pre-intervention classrooms as a control group.</span></p>
