Technology can be used to achieve learning objectives although technology itself is not the primary ingredient in creating a course that meets educational objectives. 

Teachers can use tools like the **Pedagogy First** tool created by Grand Canyon University's Center for Innovation in Research in Teaching to **help search and select technologies relevant to their course objectives**. Teachers can also ask questions with the assistance of **briefs** (like those provided by EDUCAUSE) **that summarize emerging technologies** such as: What is it? How does it work? Who’s doing it? Why is it significant? What are the downsides? Where is it going? What are the implications for higher education?

**Technology aligned to specific learning goals can then be used to:**</p>  <p>- create learning materials to accommodate visually/hearing impaired students and **increase accessibility**</p>  <p>- foster **social learning**</p>  <p>- **help students** find study groups participate in group and private messaging and receive institutional announcements</p>  <p>- **monitor students’** participation and provide facilitation and feedback as needed</p>  <p>- create digital resources to design and deliver instructional content</p>  <p>- create **blended content** that may help students develop mental representations reduce their cognitive load and test their understanding of content</p>  <p>- create online modules with simulations or new ways of visualizing content</p>  <p>- prompt students via text message to set learning goals aligned with course rubrics</p>  <p>- foster **help-seeking** with online resources and tutoring supports</p>  <p>- help students **plan and manage their time** with to-do lists task reminders embedded in calendars or timeline visualizations</p>  <p>- help students **self-monitor** their learning with prompts (or nudges) that encourage them to organize their thinking while learning (Sullivan 2016)
