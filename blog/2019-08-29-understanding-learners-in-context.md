Review the upcoming month once per week alerting yourself if several assignments are due at the same time and you need to start studying early. </span><strong>Setting calendar reminders</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> for the week before an exam project or recurring events like quizzes can prevent things from slipping through the cracks. Time management is crucial - in addition to attending class it helps learners to review one day’s work in the evening and also prepare for the following day’s assignments.</span></p>  <p> </p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>This is an example of </span><strong>The Spacing Effect</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> - learning and internalizing information over time gradually.
