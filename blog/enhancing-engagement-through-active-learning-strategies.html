            <p>Students learn more when they are actively engaged than in a passive learning environment. Active teaching strategies increase students' attendance, engagement, and acquisition of expert attitudes toward college-level science courses. However, there is a sharp contrast between how students feel about their learning and how much they actually learn. The literature supports two explanations:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Lecture-based teaching engages students cognitively to the point that they think they are learning more than they actually are.</li>
                <li>Novices in a subject are ill-equipped to gauge how much they are learning because of their poor metacognitive skills.</li>
                <li>Students who are unfamiliar with active learning may not appreciate that the cognitive struggle involved is actually a sign that learning is effective.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Students in the study experienced confusion and more cognitive effort during the small-group activities interspersed throughout lectures and interpreted this as a sign of poor learning. Students in an active learning environment also cited transitions from group activities to instructor feedback, concerns that errors made during class would not be corrected, and a general feeling of frustration and confusion when discussing concerns about actively taught classes.</p>
            <p>The success of active learning depends on students' motivation and engagement, and students must be taught to self-regulate negative emotions as they struggle with new material or participate in group work with others.</p>
