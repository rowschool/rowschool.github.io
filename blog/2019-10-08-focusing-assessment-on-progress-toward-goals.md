<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Wiggins and McTighe define a dispositional trait for instructors to </span><i><span style=font-weight: 400;>think like assessors</span></i><span style=font-weight: 400;>. This is in light of the intuition for instructors to think like instructional designers rather than initially participating in the backward planning process. This call for authenticity aligns with the work of Benjamin Bloom and colleagues (Bloom Madaus &amp; Hastings 1981 p. 265) wherein </span><strong>school tests are created with context in mind and parallel the world outside of school - where goals and criteria for success are often transparent</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;>.</span></p>  <p> </p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>They then provide several means of performing assessment iterating them along with a list of intended outcomes:</span></p>  <p> </p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>- performance tasks</span></p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>- academic prompts</span></p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>- quizzes and test items</span></p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>- informal checks for understanding and</span></p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>- other checks of understanding (e.g. oral questions concept maps portfolios observations dialogues).</span></p>  <p> </p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>The intent of assessing for understanding is to allow students to show their work and </span><strong>reveal their thinking</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> reducing the work of the instructor to infer students' learning. These assessment components should include </span><i><span style=font-weight: 400;>explanation interpretation application perspective empathy and self-knowledge detailed in UbD</span></i><span style=font-weight: 400;>. By giving students many opportunities to showcase their understanding it then becomes </span><strong>an accumulation of evidence over time</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> rather than something like a cumulative exam in which a single grade provides feedback to the instructor about student learning. </span></p>
