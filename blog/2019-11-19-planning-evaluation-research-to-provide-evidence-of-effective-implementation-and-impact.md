<p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Carver recommends using a </span><strong>tiered research approach</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> to iteratively refine course definitions of deep understanding instructional and assessment methods and research designs to yield progressively deeper explanations of effective teaching/learning processes. Courses should have cognitive models of their learning objectives which include </span><strong>specification of the knowledge representation and organization (from individual facts to conceptual networks) processing skills (procedures and strategies for performance) and developmental trajectories for any learning that researchers want to investigate (National Research Council 2001). </strong><span style=font-weight: 400;>Researchers should also consider including metacognitive knowledge and skills for planning monitoring and controlling learning as well as the attitudes and motivation. </span></p>  <p> </p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>Learning sciences researchers should consider including specific experimental manipulations within design experiments or </span><strong>running concurrent experiments to establish clear causal explanations</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> that can then serve as foundations for other design decisions. Numerous critiques of design-based investigations advocate including more experimental methods and using both design and analysis strategies to </span><strong>minimize researcher bias</strong><span style=font-weight: 400;> (Dede 2004; Kelly 2004). </span></p>  <p> </p>  <p><span style=font-weight: 400;>By using multiple methods with differing sensitivity to deep understanding plus a tiered approach ranging from a broad sample over a period of years to a single case study </span><strong>Clark and Linn were able to identify the specific role of instructional time in the learning process.
