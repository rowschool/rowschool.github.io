            <p>The Mission of the Children's Museum (CM) of Pittsburgh is to provide innovative museum experiences that inspire joy, creativity, and curiosity. Its Vision is to provide the highest quality exhibits and programs for learning and play. The CM is a partner and a resource for people who work with or on behalf of children. To bridge its objectives and actions, the CM has defined a set of values: Commitment to Good Design Principles (attention to aesthetics and practicality creates functional, welcoming commu…</p>
            <p>The CM is funded by donations, admission and membership fees, and special fees for events such as birthdays and workshops.</p>
            <p>In honor of its Play with Real Stuff approach, students have the opportunity to play music, hands-on activities that explore science and technology, health, nutrition and mindfulness practices, and nature-focused exploration during various days of the week.</p>
            <p>Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, a part of Buzzword PGH, a cultural collaborative that supports children age 0-5 and their caregivers in literacy and learning, and every Friday, Early Learning Museum Educators hold Intentional Interactions with the PPS Classrooms.</p>
            <p>Through these sessions, CM connects informal Museum experiences to the Big Day for Pre-K curriculum, embodying the idea that learning transcends the classroom.</p>
            <p>More information is available at https://www.hmhco.com/products/big-day-pre-k/big-day-for-prekindergarten-overview.htm</p>
            <p>The CM asserts that play is a way for children to learn who they are, how the world works, solve problems, and to express feelings. It offers unique experiences for classrooms, afterschool programs, libraries, or camp groups designed to promote learning without even realizing it while aligning exhibit spaces to Pennsylvania’s Learning Standards for Early Childhood.</p>
