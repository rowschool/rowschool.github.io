            <p>ECS <strong>aims to grow actively engaged citizens driving thoughtful change in the world around them</strong> by means of their ecoliteracy program. ECS is committed to building systems thinkers by means of having students <strong>explore the environment its ecology and diversity and applying interdisciplinary perspectives to engage and explore problems</strong>. ECS according to its Founding Principal and CEO Jon McCann aims to transform students into global citizens will need to be equipped with skills that allow them to be <strong>flexible thinkers creative problem solvers and effective leaders</strong>.</p>
            <p>The prime directive of ECS' faculty and staff are to ensure all students succeed at a high level <strong>becoming problem solvers critical thinkers and thoughtful innovators who are prepared to thrive in our changing society</strong>. The organization and programs at the school are designed and continually refined in pursuit of fulfilling that aim. This is achieved by means of <strong>collaboration reflection and progressivism</strong>.</p>
            <p>For example ECS features a Middle School Thinking Lab which employs Visible Thinking in order to build thinking dispositions. The goals of the Thinking Lab are for students to bridge art and science by :</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    using verbal visual and critical thinking skills to identify understand and express problems that cross disciplines
                </li>
                <li>
                    making connections between science art technology and design and
                </li>
                <li>incubating and activating within the lab an innovative learning community and inspiring active collaboration between ECS faculty and partner organizations.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Through focus groups surveys and classroom visits ECS has continued to expand to serve grades K-12 across three campuses by 2020. ECS identified <strong>four themes during its most recent growth phase - Programming Looping Schedule and Spaces</strong> - and created a framework for planning logistics and guiding decisions at the building level.</p>

            <p>ECS aims to <strong>feed students with healthy and fresh food</strong> (85% of which is made from scratch) while keeping costs low and reducing food waste. Families are encouraged to complete a Federal Free and Reduced lunch form and the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) is used to feed children (via an English or Spanish number) breakfast lunch and/or snacks during the summer months. To these ends ECS has outlined a Wellness Policy.</p>

            <p>ECS also has an <strong>accessibility/disability Civil Rights policy</strong> (https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a1ed6c2f43b55b309dbceb3/t/5a2aec94ec212d9a4f2c320e/1512762516762/Civil-rights-statement.pdf) and <strong>counseling services to support students' social/emotional academic and career needs</strong>. <strong>Students are taught to build coping self-regulation and conflict resolution skills</strong> and are offered a variety of other counseling services.</p>
